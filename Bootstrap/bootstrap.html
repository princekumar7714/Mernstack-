      <p>
        India, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. It is made
        up of 28 states and eight union territories, and its national capital is
        New Delhi, built in the 20th century just south of the historic hub of
        Old Delhi to serve as India’s administrative center. Its government is a
        constitutional republic that represents a highly diverse population
        consisting of thousands of ethnic groups and hundreds of languages.
        India became the world’s most populous country in 2023, according to
        estimates by the United Nations. It is known from archaeological
        evidence that a highly sophisticated urbanized culture—the Indus
        civilization—dominated the northwestern part of the subcontinent from
        about 2600 to 2000 bce. From that period on, India functioned as a
        virtually self-contained political and cultural arena, which gave rise
        to a distinctive tradition that was associated primarily with Hinduism,
        the roots of which possibly can be traced to the Indus civilization.
        Other religions, notably Buddhism and Jainism, originated in
        India—though their presence there is now quite small—and throughout the
        centuries residents of the subcontinent developed a rich intellectual
        life in such fields as mathematics, astronomy, architecture, literature,
        music, and the fine arts. Quick Facts Flag of India See article: flag of

        (foreground) Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, India, designated a World Heritage
        site in 2013. Throughout its history, India was intermittently disturbed
        by incursions from beyond its northern mountain wall. Especially
        important was the coming of Islam, brought from the northwest by Arab,
        Turkish, Persian, and other raiders beginning early in the 8th century
        ce. Eventually, some of those raiders stayed; by the 13th century much
        of the subcontinent was under Muslim rule, and the number of Muslims
        steadily increased. Only after the arrival of the Portuguese navigator
        Vasco da Gama in 1498 and the subsequent establishment of European
        maritime supremacy in the region did India become exposed to major
        external influences arriving by sea, a process that culminated in the
        decline of the ruling Muslim elite and absorption of the subcontinent
        within the British Empire. Direct administration by the British, which
        began in 1858, effected a political and economic unification of the
        subcontinent. As a result of the Indian Independence Movement, British
        rule came to an end on August 14-15, 1947, celebrated annually as
        Independence Day. The subcontinent was then partitioned along religious
        lines into two separate countries—India, with a majority of Hindus, and
        Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims; the eastern portion of Pakistan
        later split off to form Bangladesh. Many British institutions stayed in
        place (such as the parliamentary system of government); English
        continued to be a widely used lingua franca; and India remained within
        the Commonwealth. Hindi became the official language (and a number of
        other local languages achieved official status), while a vibrant
        English-language intelligentsia thrived.
