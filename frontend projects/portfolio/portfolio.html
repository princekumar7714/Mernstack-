          A **frontend developer** is a professional who builds the visual and
          interactive parts of a website or web application that users interact
          with directly. They use technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and
          **JavaScript** to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
          Frontend developers work closely with designers to bring layouts and
          wireframes to life and may also collaborate with backend developers to
          integrate APIs and data. Their goal is to ensure a seamless and
          engaging user experience across different devices and browsers.
